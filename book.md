1. gcd_two_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int: A function that accepts two positive integers and calculates
their GCD.
2. gcd_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int: A function that accepts a list of positive integers and
calculates their GCD. It should use `gcd_two_numbers` in its implementation.
3. get_numbers() -> List[int]: A function that reads a list of positive integers from the user, validates
the inputs, and returns the list. It should continue prompting the user for input until a valid list is
given. If the user enters something invalid, it should raise a ValueError with an appropriate error
message.
